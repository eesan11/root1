<dl>
    <dt>Reason 1 </dt>
    <dd>The use of white letters and grid against a black background is high contrast, creating a distinct visualization. </dd>
    <dt>Reason 2</dt>
    <dd>The spare use of green and yellow set certain letters apart indicating something special with them in the game.</dd>
    <dt>Reason 3</dt>
    <dd>They use a combination of a serif font for the heading and sans serif for text. </dd>
    <ol start = "2">
        <li>Repitition</li>
    </ol>
    <bl>
        <li>Example: The Sill Website </li></bl>
    <a href="https://www.thesill.com">The Sill</a>
    <dl>
        <dt>Reason 1 </dt>
        <dd>The website repeats the same font throughout and only changes font size for products and uses italics for product options. </dd>
        <dt>Reason 2</dt>
        <dd>The website has consistent spatial alignment between photos and between website sections.</dd>
        <dt>Reason 3</dt>
        <dd>The photos of plants adds texture to the website. </dd>

    <li>Alignment</li>
    </ol>
    <bl>
        <li>Example:Door Dash Website </li></bl>
    <a href="https://www.doordash.com">Door Dash</a>
    <dl>
        <dt>Reason 1 </dt>
        <dd>Above the fold on the website is their logo and tagline on a high contrast photo of different foods against a red background - this is to draw people in and recognize their brand. </dd>
        <dt>Reason 2</dt>
        <dd>When you scroll down the next section is a curated list of popular restaurants near your address. The website uses consistent spatial alignment between food photos from the popular, nearby restuarants.</dd>
  <ol start = "4">
    <li>Proximity</li>
  </ol>
  <bl>
      <li>Example: Umami Mart Website</li>
  </bl>
  <a href="https://umamimart.com">Umami Mart</a>
  <dl>
    <dt>Reason 1 </dt>
    <dd>All of the websites elements are centered, e.g. text and photos, and fall neatly within borders of consistent white space.</dd>
    <dt>Reason 2</dt>
    <dd>Related elements are logically grouped, such as product categories, making it easy for customers to shop.</dd>
    <dd>There is a visual hierachy to the website with their logo centered and on the top of the page, then product category links directly below. It gives enough information without having to scroll down, but is visually pleasant enough that a customer might be intrigued. </dd>
