<dl>
    <dt>Reason 1 </dt>
    <dd>The use of white letters and grid against a black background is high contrast, creating a distinct visualization. </dd>
    <dt>Reason 2</dt>
    <dd>The spare use of green and yellow set certain letters apart indicating something special with them in the game.</dd>
    <dt>Reason 3</dt>
    <dd>They use a combination of a serif font for the heading and sans serif font for text. </dd>
    <ol start = "2">
        <li><b>Repitition</b></li>

    <dl>
        <dt>Reason 1 </dt>
        <dd>The website repeats the same font throughout and only changes font size for products <br> and uses italics for product options. </dd>
        <dt>Reason 2</dt>
        <dd>The website has consistent spatial alignment between photos and between website sections.</dd>
        <dt>Reason 3</dt>
        <dd>The photos of plants adds texture to the website. </dd>
  <ol start = "3">
    <li><b>Alignment</b></li>
</ol>

    <dl>
        <dt>Reason 1 </dt>
        <dd>Above the fold on the website is their logo and tagline on a high contrast photo of different foods <br> against a red background - this is to draw people in and recognize their brand. </dd>
        <dt>Reason 2</dt>
        <dd>When you scroll down the next section is a curated list of popular restaurants near your address.<br> The website uses consistent spatial alignment between food photos from popular, nearby restuarants.</dd>

  <dl>
    <dt>Reason 1 </dt>
    <dd>All of the websites elements are centered, e.g. text and photos, and fall neatly within borders of consistent white space.</dd>
    <dt>Reason 2</dt>
    <dd>Related elements are logically grouped, such as product categories, making it easy for customers to shop.</dd>
    <dt>Reason 3</dt>
    <dd>There is a visual hierachy to the website with their logo centered and on the top of the page, then product category links directly below. <br>It gives enough information without having to scroll down, but is visually pleasant enough that a customer might be intrigued. </dd>
